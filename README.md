# Compartment Model

The goal of this work was to re-use the [compartment model] (https://github.com/guertinlab/modeling_PRO_composites) project and arrange it in a way to streamline its use by others.

For details on compartment model, please read the vignette present in the link in the previous paragraph or refer to publications from Dr. Michael Guertin's lab such as Sathyan et. al. 2019 and Dutta et. al. 2021.

A workflow to use this package is present as `compartmentModel_efferocytosis.html` and a manual of all the functions used is present as `compartmentModel-manual.pdf`.
